### https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/soclevel1

## Objectives: 
- Detect and analyse traffic anomalies
- Monitor endpoints for threats
- Utilise SIEM tools to handle incidents
- Investigate forensic artefacts

## My Experience:

As an aspiring SOC analyst, I was naturally excited to complete TryHackMe's dedicated training for the role. The course was a wide overview into so many different industry tools and frameworks, and I enjoyed getting hands on experience with many toosl that I had never even heard of. Using SIEM's/Wireshark/Snort was fun and expected, but there were also many other rooms where I had to use new tools I had never heard of like Autopsy/Zeek/OSquery etc.
